      <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">Published on June 30, 2025</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In this blog, Iâ€™ll walk you through how I created my dynamic portfolio website using core PHP, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL. 
        This project was part of my effort to display my academic and personal projects, certificates, experience, and more.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I created an admin panel to manage projects and blog content using forms and file uploads, and used includes for reusable components like header and footer. 
        Tailwind CSS helped me maintain a clean, responsive design throughout.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Overall, building this site gave me deeper experience with dynamic routing, session management, form validation, and visual polish using Tailwind's utility classes.
        This blog is a reflection of that journey.
